- [LiveReload - sparse directions :frown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/livereload)

###Directions for use:
- cd into your working folder
- clone or copy this repo into working folder
- run the following in bash:

    $ `npm install --global gulp-cli`         <-- installs gulp-cli globally

    $ `npm install --global gulp` <-- installs gulp globally

    $ `gem install sass`   # or `gem update sass` if you have sass already

    $ `gem install bourbon`  <-- installs bourbon on your system

    $ `gem install neat`

    $ `npm init`  <-- initilizes this project with NPM

    $ `npm install`  <-- installs the file dependencies included in the package.json file

    $ `gulp serve` <-- use this command to start gulp services.  This will automatically
    open the localhost and precompile SASS and Jade assets on save.


- The following steps were used to create the file contents of this repo:

    $ `bourbon install`  <-- install bourbon dependency files in your working directory

    $ `neat install`

    $ `npm install --save-dev gulp`

    $ `npm install --save-dev gulp-sass`

    $ `npm install --save-dev gulp-jade`

    $ `npm install --save-dev gulp-util`

    $ `npm install --save-dev gulp-load-plugins`

    $ `npm install --save node-bourbon`

    $ `npm install —-save node-neat`

    $ `npm install —-save bourbon`

    $ `npm install --save-dev browser-sync`



###Directory Structure and File Explanation:
-->insert file structure here,TODO, in progress >

website  <-- the main working directory, name this whatevs you would like
  |_.sas-cache  <-- auto generated by gulp, don't touch, not used directly by developer

  |_bourbon  <-- auto generated by running the $ `boubon install` command, contains the mixins used by bourbon, don't touch

  |_img  <-- includes custom favicons.  replase these with your own but be sure to keep the names the same

- create index.jade file (an index.html will be generated by Gulp/Jade task) after precompiling the Jade formatted doc.

- create website/stylesheet/style.scss
  - add the following to your styles.scss
     ```scss
     @import "../bourbon/bourbon";
     @import "../neat/neat";


###Automation
- Gulp is set up to automate the precomplitation of resources and open the browser with
browsersync.  Simply input $ `gulp` in the command line.
- If you do not want to open the browser and use live reload it is possible to
initiate only the precompilers independently.
 - To precompile SASS use $ `gulp styles`
 - To precompile Jade use $ `gulp jade`
 - To only run the server $ `gulp serve`
